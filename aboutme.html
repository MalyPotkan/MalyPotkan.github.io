<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<p>I am a Slovak student.
  Since middle school I have been attending art classes. In general I like to draw, but I did not move any further than that.
 Few years later I fell in love with graphics and did online book covers for writers. Later, during one school project, when I had to work with a camera, was when I discovered I actually really enjoy photographing and video recording.
 Nowadays, I am also interested in programming and web design and hope to become a professional UX designer/programmer/software or game developer.

<h3>What is MouseVision?</h3>
<p>This nickname was created with a big help of my friends. I needed something to present myself and show my skills without using my real name. Something, that has a personal meaning.
    People, who are very close to me like to call me a mouse or a squirell. I really adore that nickname, since I am a big fan of rodents. So I used that and connected it to the word "Vision" which in this case represents my vision of art/web design or the world in general.
